Introduction
============

mobilize.js is an experimental HTML5 framework to do website mobilization on the client side.
It detects mobile browser and formats the web page for touch optimized displays
using jQuery Mobile UI framework.

Features
================

* One <script> tag integration

* Touch optimized user interface based on jQuery Mobile

* Cloud hosting: optimized JS and CSS from the cloud, no need to maintain your own server

Detect mobile browse
================================

`If you only need to detect mobile browsers in Javascript try here <https://github.com/mobilizejs/mobilize.js>`_.
Mobilize.js is full blown mobile site rendering solution and might be overkill just for mobile browser detection.
