Fallback to the web page
-------------------------

When a non-supported device arrives to the site, the normal web page is rendered.

Other devices
-----------------------

mobilize.js device support grows with jQuery Mobile UI framework.
When it gets more device support.

Eventually all Javascript capable mobile browsers will be supported. 

Low end devices 
------------------

mobilize.js is based on Javascript transformations, meaning that you need
to have a Javascript capable browser running it. 
However, client side Javascript support is not a hard requirement.
mobilize.js can be also executed on server-side, using  
a theming proxy server. 
For the details, please contact the development team.
