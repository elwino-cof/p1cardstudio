What are you doing Pete the Hacker? You
look so excited.

I just finished a fifty lines Python app playing Go perfectly. 
Now I am Mobilizing websites for our customers.

Gosh. Isn't mobilizing a difficult task? You need to care about 
thousand of different devices, screen sizes, formats,
standards and everything. 

Not anymore. I just found Mobilize.js.
It is a new open source project allowing
you to mobilize any web site with
few lines of Javascript code.

The key innovation in Mobilize.js
is to embraces the orignal idea
of HTML mark-up language: 
the browser knows best how the
page should look like. 
Mobilize.js embeds a Javascript
on a the web page which will
contain the code how it should look
on mobile.

Gosh. So clever. 

Indeed. Embdedded web services like maps, 
analytics and ads have gone to Javascript already.
Mobilization is the next natural step.

Does it work with my old a crappy PHP site I created when I was still young and needed the money?

Yes. It works any site where you can include Javascript code. You don't
need even to upload files to the server - Mobilize.js is hosted
from public content deliver servers.

Gosh. So clever. 
Does it  work with my Wordpress blog?

Yes. Mobilize.js has a plug-in for Wordpress. 
Being so easy to integrate, 
Mobilize.js has or will have plug-ins for all major web platforms,
enabling mobilization even for site integrators who
don't know HTML.

Is it compatible Microsoft Sharepoint?

Yes. $$$.

Does it...

Yes.

Awesome. I'll start following Mobilize.js
in Twitter right away. I'll subscribe to 
their RSS feed and news letter. Then
I'll read the tutorial and tap
the potential of fast growing mobile internet.
